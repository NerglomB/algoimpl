This is just a hobby project. I try to implement different algorithms to learn in general and Kotlin.

Currently implemented:
- Strippacking
    - Modified version of ffdh
   
   
Ideas for the future:
- More strippacking
- knapsack
- cluster detection
- path finding
- datastructures like a btree or rtree
